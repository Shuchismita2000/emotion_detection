# emotion_detection

When I started learning about NLP , from then I am quite interesting in Emotion Detection.
It's obvious , this model will not given accurate emotion. Still it's a case study. 
I am trying to apply various model of ml to classify emotion .
In future obviously I will work on it.
I deploy the model with help of Streamlit and Heroku .
